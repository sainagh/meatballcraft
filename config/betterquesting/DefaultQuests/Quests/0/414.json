      "desc:8": "The picture of how the recursive powers of the Twilight Horde are making a bit more sense, although I am still not quite sure about the full picture here.\nEach of the Shells part of the Horde\u0027s territories holds these gems, which possesses powerful recursive properties. Each gem is tied to the power of the world that is located farther in, and it transmits something magical in nature to the outer layers of the Shells. What this power or influence may be, I do not know, but it reminds me of a communication device between the Shells.\nAs I got my hands on the gem in the Eden, the effects were negligible. \nWhen I took the gem from Wildwood, I did notice a bit of a change in the organization of my enemies, they suddenly felt more erratic.\nBut not that I have gotten the Apalachia gem, the negative effect on the logistics of the Twilight Horde was noticeable. My enemies are scrambling, some even seem to have totally diserted. It seems like something may have fully broken.",
