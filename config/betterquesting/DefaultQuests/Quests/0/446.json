What I fought here were nothing but shadows of the true power of these beings; although I was able to banish them, they will likely come back, and this time, they will face me with their full might.\nThankfully, they are too strong to face me on Terra, as they alone would annhilate their treasured Dimensional Shards together with me.\nI cannot take any chances, though, if the balance of this war were to change, who knows what these opponents may be capable of.",
