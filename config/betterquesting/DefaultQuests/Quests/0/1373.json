Another shall be a more worthy successor of Xxeus.\nTo be honest, I am not even sure if I would be any good at it. I am a tinkerer, an experimentalist, an engineer, definitely not a botanist.\nThis does not mean I will not try to take hold of the little Sacred Cinders magic I am given the ability to wield, though!\nI definitely will not grow big powerful trees, but who knows, I may even be able to grow my little Sacred Cinders flowers one day. Or even empower my Tree of Life.",
