Were I to fight the leaders of the Twilight Horde and Shyre Empire over and over, for all eternity, very little would change.\nI better start learning from my enemies; thankfully, they let something slip up. With all its bolstering of being the lord of Time, Bane may have given me a way into the world of Fractallites, and possibly becoming one.\nThe chickens created in Greckon, while not being fully Fractallite, seem to possess echoes of their maker\u0027s power, echoes that are much more understandable. Since I know how these chickens work, I was able to discern what makes these ones different, I was able to see (for the lack of a better word) a shadow of what being Fractallite actually means.\nYes, as I am now, there is little I can do, but this is a first step, and the direction seems to be the right one!",
