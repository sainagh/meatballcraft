      "desc:8": "I said that being a Fractallite means embodying a mission, but that is not fully correct.\nThat is what is required of becoming a Fractallite. The act of entering the mission is only the first step to a commitment that is eternal. \nCommitting for eternity, that is hard, beyond hard. The sole thought of it brings me an incredible anguish. \nThis thought, this fear, this anguish, is the thought every Fractallite had to endure, and has to endure every day of their existence.\nThat is why the Meatball Man, the leaders of the Shyre Empire, and the beasts of the Twilight Horde are now the way they are. Eternity is too much for someone that is born mortal. Eventually, the mission becomes too much, too heavy of a burden. And that is when the burden is dropped.\nI do not resent them for doing it, weirdly enough. I understand it.\nAnd yet, I understand that it is my mission, my calling as a Fractallite, to put a stop to them.\nThat is why, here, in this world of nightmare, where the true essence of this reality becomes evident, I will face the Wither, guardian of Terra brought forth by the Arbiter, to become mission!",
