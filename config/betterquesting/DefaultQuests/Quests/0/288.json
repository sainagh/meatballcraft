Dead by the hands of the Meatball Man.\nFull of righteusness, the god of the Testificates had chased his foe into Pixonia, and there, they had their confrontation. Only one of the two would coume out of that encounter.\nAfter not hearing back from their master, faithful of the Arbiter followed the undead into the land of the Meatball Man, and there they discovered what had happened.\nWhat was left of the Arbiter on Terra were only two things, a strange sequence of characters, unreadable by any Testificate, and a letter, with a prophecy.",
