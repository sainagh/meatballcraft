Someone very, very powerful is on my side; well, on the side that is against the Shyre Empire at least.\nIt took some digging into the hidden history of Runandor, safekept by its leaders and hidden even from the Shyre Empire, a hidden history about this world\u0027s original deity (or pantheon, the language is unclear).\nWhoever used to be worshipped by these people, it is a very powerful being, someone capable of touching all individuals in the universe solely through their power. A universal entity, not unlike the Meatball Man.\nIf the Meatball Man\u0027s power is over gluttony, the power of this being revolves around prosperity.\nAlchemy is a gift of prosperity, bestowed by this power, and freely given as gift. After betrayal, though, this gift was taken away from Runandor; the betrayal, I believe, was joining the Shyre Empire.\nThis gift was given to me, and to many of the enemies of the Shyre Empire; is it safe to assume that this being may be my ally?",
