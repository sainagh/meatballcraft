      "desc:8": "As far as I know, Xxeus and the Arbiter never had any close interaction.\nAnd yet, it is the true power of Alkemia, one that Xxeus so jealously held, that is now completing the puzzle behind the Arbiter\u0027s projects in Proxima.\nDefinition, that is the mission of the Testificates\u0027 ruler. To bring order, to define, to name.\nThat is science, drawing borders around something, learning what it is, definining it.\nAnd the power of the arbiter is just that, Definition.\nAnd this power uses Alchemy as its primary recursive field. A field I am now finally fully in tune with.\nFinally, I can learn more of the Arbiter, and I can truly start to follow their steps.\nWhere is the Arbiter? To follow, I must too start wielding the powers of Definition, I must see the traces they left.",
