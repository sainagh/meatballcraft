A single brick.\nI have no idea how or why, but a single remain of the abundance of the Lord of Prosperity was taken by the people of Runandor, and buried deep into their creation.\nA sin of greed, that is how I would call it. Due to fear of losing everything they were given, the people of Runandor had decided to hide what was left to them after being forsaken. Instead of showing it, they hid it, scared others may take it.\nAnd yet, I still took it from them. Am I committing the same sin as they are? Is this search for Fractallite powers just a way to tell myself I hold value? Am I convincing myself I can do it when I cannot?",
