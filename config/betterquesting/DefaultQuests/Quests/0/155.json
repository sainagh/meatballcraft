      "desc:8": "It is thanks to fusion that I can now mythically generate matter from the Ayeraco.\nAnd here\u0027s another link between magical forces. I have no idea what type of powers the majestic beasts that are the Ayeracos hold, but it\u0027s emergent from nuclear interactions.\nWell, mythic magic as a whole seems to come from nuclear interactions, almost as if nuclear fusion and fission could be controlled without the explosions and massive heat.\nAnd on the other hand, there is a connections between recursion and the mere existence of atoms as shown by the existence of meatballium.\nI initially thought mythic properties were the basis of magic, as they are directly tied to the control of reality, but now I think there may be something deeper.",
