      "desc:8": "§7§oThis way for Orechid and Recursive Powder.\n\n§fI have yet to encounter any form of industrialization within the territories of the Shyre Empire, and the Twilight Horde has little more organization than a pack of animals. And yet, likely thanks to magic, they can deal with natural resources quite well, without big factories, assembly lines, and logistics infrastructure.\nI, on the other hand, do enjoy the systematic approach to resource management humanity came up with, so this is how I operate (if was not clear by now).\nDespite this, though, I have to admit that, the more knowledge I have aquired on recursion, the more innovative and efficient means of resource management I was able to devise.\nLooking at the recursive materials I have encountered so far, something tells me I may just be scratching the surface of what\u0027s possible with them.\nObtaining essentia, in my early days as a thaumaturge, was quite hard; but now, thanks to some industrialization and more magical knowledge, it is not as much of an issue. I suspect the same may be true about these new mythic resources.",
