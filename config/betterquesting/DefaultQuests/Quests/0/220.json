      "desc:8": "While the being behind the corruption of the Abyss appears to be somewhat intangible, something like Ashora or the elusive Oblivionaire in the Abyssal Wastelands, it has a form that is perceivable in the three-dimensional world I inhabit.\nThis form is of large flesh tendrils originating from somewhere inside the world. Its minions inhabit these tendrils, and they hold some secrets I was able to discover.\nThis flesh is in itself recursive, which is strange. I am recursive, but every time I return my remains are not, and neither are the remains of any of the enemies I have slain so far. Remains like the divine shards have properties that are useful for magic, but they are not themselves magic. The flesh of this being, though, is in itself an agent of magic, capable of controlling the world around it, as if it had a will, even when hacked off.\nThis can be used, I think, for some weapon-making.",
