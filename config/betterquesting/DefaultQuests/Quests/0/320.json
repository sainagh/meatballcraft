      "desc:8": "The secret of Alkemia. Pure alchemical matter. Bright and resplendent! \nThe history of the Shyre Empire and Alchemy goes even deeper than I thought. \nBased on the information currently available, I cannot clearly enstablish the order of these happenings, so piecing together a story will be tricky, but here is what I know.\nFirstly, the ability to perform Alchemy was actively prevented to members of the Shyre Empire by some sort of higher power tied to this form of magic, likely a Fractallite.\nSecondly, the Shyre Empire used to hoard all the Alchemical matter in Alkemia, and hid it behind what are possibly the most advanced magical barriers in the universe.\nThirdly, the Empire used to actively seek out and try to annex people, like the inhabitants of Runandor and the Deeplands, that were in tune with Alchemy.\nDid Xxeus\u0027 greed to hoard alchemical powers cause some conflict against the master of Alchemy?\nDid this enmity exist before the Empire, and this hoarding is so that nobody else could use alchemy as well?\nWho knows, maybe one day I will meet the master of Alchemy one day...\nI wonder if this has anything to do with the Realmshifter\u0027s deity, they are supposedly masters of alchemy...",
