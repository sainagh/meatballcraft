      "desc:8": "As I probably should have expected, the fall of such influential powers produced  ripples throughout the universe.\nThe Shyre Empire, as the presence of many Elder Ones in its territories shows, did not shy away from entering alliances with powerful beings, who are now adjusting, often violently, to this newly formed power vacuum.\nOne of such beings, so intimately close to Xxeus to be granted access to the Shyrelands, is the enemy that the Dragonslayers seeked to destroy.\nThe Arbiter was not the only master of Dragons, it seems. Another Draconic master, who knows under what conditions, lent its powers to Xxeus to wipe out a powerful civilization. A civilization that, after being nearly annhilated, became the Dragonslayers, a people solely devoted to the taking of the Cursed Cradle, the bane of its forefathers.\nThe campaign of the Dragonslayers alas, was cut short by the Defiler.\nIt is with their struggle in my heart that I now avenge them, and it is through their inherited will that I now break the cursed cradle, and bring peace to a people that is now only remembered by me.\nYou are not forgotten, your struggles have not been in vain.\nYour story will be told throughout the cosmos, this I vow!",
