And yet, while being just a feeling, I have never felt more certain about who I am. I am a Human, I am a person, I am free.\nAnd no, this prison that so vehemently prevents me to go home, it holds no power over my freedom.\nDo you hear me Meatball Man? Do you feel my resolve?\nDespite all your attempts to prod me, to push me towards a fate you believe is in your hands, I am still free. Free to hit this shield with all my might.\nYou are the one that placed me so close to eternity, who gave me all the time in the world to beat on your shield. You are the one who gave me time time to learn, to develop, and ultimately to act.\nHear these words Meatball Man! I am just a toy to you now, but I will break throught your rampart, and when I do, you better be ready to fight, because nothing but your full might will be able to stop me!",
