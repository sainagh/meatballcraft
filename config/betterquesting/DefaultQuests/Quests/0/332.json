      "desc:8": "...And once again, the answer is mythic excavation!\nI found the compound responsible for Lelyetia's strange condition, fluctuatite, a mineral that seems to be part of most compounds in the land.\nUnlike anything I've seen so far, its gravitational field lines intersect a plane, instead of a sphere, which is what normal matter does.\nIt also possesses complex gravity, like sednanite.\nI don't have any fluctuatite in my own body, though, which is why I feel weird when I'm in Lelyetia.\nGood news, I can make fluctuatite! Bad news, to achieve the folding of space-time I see in that strange world will need several planets worth of it, at least according to my math.\nThere's clearly not that much fluctuatite on Lelyetia, so I have to assume there are things I still do not know...\nAlso, the existance of this material makes Lelyetia quite different from Arcana, or other lands of the Twilight Horde. The physical phenomena are the same one, complex gravity being used to create infinite planes of existance separate from the three dimensions of space, but the way ther are achieved is different.",
