The furnaces can take control over you, and turn you into a mindless husk, enslaved to their will, whatever that may be.\nPower and greatness being a source of corruption I understand, and I can definitely say I felt it (who wouldn\u0027t?!?); what I do not understand, is how does one escape this call?\nPower from other sources seems to be pointless; the Hellfire being I just faced has a might like no other I have seen, and yet it seemed like nothing in comparison to the call of the furnace dimension. \nI am definitely facing something I am not ready to best, I think it will be good to leave the furnace dimension be until I can understand what is going on...",
