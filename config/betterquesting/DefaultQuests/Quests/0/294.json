If a fly is barely bothering you, after all, why try to kill it?\nThe damage I have done to the \"weaker\" Shyre and Twilight worlds is undeniable, but my effect on the more important worlds is undeniably less noticeable. Well, pretty much unnoticeable. \nWhat changed? Well, until now, I was just dealing with mere recursive beings. Now, on the other hand, I am facing full fledged fractallites.\nIs it that I am simply to weak to touch recursion the same way they do? Is it that I am not strong enough? Yes, it may be it!\nI got here, thinking I had the tools, but I do not, I am not strong enough!",
