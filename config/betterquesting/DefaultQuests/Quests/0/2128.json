A monster of endless hunger, and one of the lieutenants of the undead horde, this creature\u0027s power revolves around the consumption of souls who died a violent death; the more that are consumed, the stronger this being gets.\nIt seems like the magical power provided by a single soul may be quite low, which is even more concerning. How many must have died to achieve the foe I have faced? ",
