      "desc:8": "Eureka! I found the missing link! \nNot only gravity can be positive or negative, it can also be imaginary, producing rotations around non-existing objects.\nMetals like the one found on sedna, this cold, strange planet, produce motion that would be otherwise impossible at such distance from a star.\nThis allows the planet to orbit a point located somewhere near Sol, yet this motion would happen anyway even if the star wasn\u0027t there!\nManipulations of this type, at a much, much, much, larger scale are probably what guides the powers of the Twilight Horde, looking at the dungeon of Arcana.\nBut here is a philosophical question, is the warping of space caused by the emergent properties of materials like Sednanite, or are materials like Sednanite brought forth by spatial anomalies, or are both a consequence of somthing else, something more fundamental.\nIf I want answers to this question, I\u0027ll have to come to the great powers of this universe, I suspect.",
