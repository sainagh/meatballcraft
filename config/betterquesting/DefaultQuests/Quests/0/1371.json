      "desc:8": "And from the Acorn, Twin Saplings, the two faces of freedom.\nThe ability to empower others, and the ability to constrain them.\nThis is the gift of freedom, true freedom. A gift so hard to give.\nWill my actions bring forth another Xxeus, another Meatball Man?\nThat is the price of this gift. A price I alone will be responsible for, and yet one I must give.\nI now understand the need for Ascension, the need for freedom.\nOnly one who has understood the mission, one who has embraced divinity, will be capable of making such a choice, to take on the burden of granting freedom.\nIf my had journey had been different, if I hadn\u0027t witnessed what Xxeus had done by witholding this gift, would I have done the same? Would I have kept the acorn from germinating?\nIf Destiny is listening, if the Fractallite in charge of Fate is looking upon me know, I thank them. I thank them for the struggle, the pain, the desperation, of laying eyes on the oppressed, the burdened, the imprisoned. If it hadn\u0027d been for them, I would not have the strength to do what I am now doing.\nSo thank you, thank you, thank you.",
