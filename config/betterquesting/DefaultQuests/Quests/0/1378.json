As free as someone can be after having gone through what they have.\nNow, it is up to them to rebuild, to make mistakes, to learn.\nWho knows, one day, my path of order from Chaos, will one day bring me back to these lands.\nBut for now, this moment is just theirs. \nTo the people of Lelyetia, Precasia, Abyss, Creeponia, Deeplands, Barathos, Mysterium, Iromine, Gardencia, Crystevia, Candyland, Vox, Haven, Celeve, Runandor, L\u0027Borean, Lunalus, Greckon, Dustopia, Immortallis! This time is yours!\nYou are free, so act as such. Unburdened by fear and doubt, regain your steps, and make them your own, because nobody else will do it for you.\nWhat you have done under the foot of the Fractallite of Rule, that is all gone. Your mistakes will now be your mistakes. Your successes will now be your successes. \nFreedom is a heavy burden, especialy after what you have been through. But I am sure that you will rise up to the challenge, and make it your own.\nAfter all, you are free.",
