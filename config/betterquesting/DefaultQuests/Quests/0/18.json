I can make runes! \nAs a man of science, I do feel quite embarassed about the way I looked at the civilizations of the past. The middle ages were definitely not a time of darkness, and some great knowledge was discovered then.\nAre these the same runes vikings used to make? No, I don\u0027t think so. But at least I have a lead on some possible greatness our history forgot.\nUnfortunately, we decided to go for industrialization, and we shunned runes. Shame.",
