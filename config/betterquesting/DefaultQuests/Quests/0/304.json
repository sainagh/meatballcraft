      "desc:8": "There it is, that paradox that has plagued countless minds. Are we truly free, or are our actions the only phycically reasonable reaction to a universe that progresses without agency?\nThanks to what I am capable of seeing in myself, I know I have agency. I also know that there are things I will do. Not \u0027can do\u0027, \u0027will do\u0027. What are these things? I am getting closer to understanding them, and I suspect that my ascension will involve achieving this understanding, but I do not yet know them.\nSo the paradox persists. It seems that, even at this most fundamental level of reality, the paradox persists.",
