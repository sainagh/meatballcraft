Terra is the size of a gas giant, yet, it is able to stay solid thanks to strong fields generated by the dimensional shards located within its crust.\nThis is also the cause for the existence of asteroid belts and sky islands located within its atmosphere.\nDimensional Shards, when looked at a macroscopic scale, produce negative gravity, this allowing for really cool phenomena.\nAnd it does make sense why the invaders of Terra want larger and larger amounts of Shards. Well, not fully to be honest, the Twilight Horde was able to bring forth an infinite fortress that defies the laws of nature out of thin air without the need of the space-warping properties of Shards. What else can you do with them?",
