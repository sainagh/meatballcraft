      "desc:8": "The creepers, these sad creatures of destruction, are yet another product of recursion. \nIt seems the ability to use this power was given to the higher up of Creeponia, who I know to still be an artificially created being. So recursion works on artificial life too. \nThe more I study new powers from my powerful enemies, the more it seems to relate back to recursion. To an extent, I am gaining more independence over my own recursive powers, could it be that I may achieve similar abilities too. Not that I want to, but one has to ask. Is this a result of a single power, or are there other factors at play I cannot imagine? Would I be able to turn creatures created through essence into recursive beings? \nWhat makes a creature alive? Back on Earth, we never considered essence animals to be truly alive, they lached the \u0027will\u0027 real animals have. And now I am confronted with artificial life that\u0027s even capable of magic.\nAnd this all gets back to the nature of recursion, I really have to figure out how it works!\n",
