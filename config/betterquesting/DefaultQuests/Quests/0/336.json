      "desc:8": "The Deeplands are a cave world, a planet with a surface so incredibly uninhabitable, and with a spawling underground that\u0027s completely separated from its outer layer.\nLife here was born of charged runium, an \u0027excited\u0027 (that\u0027s the best word I can think of at the moment) counterpart of the compound found on Terra. Although it lacks EMC, it has clear alchemical properties, which seem to be responsible for the existence of livable areas in this planet. It can spontaneously transmute rock into air and other ingredients of life, at a slow but steady rate.\nHow does this process work, though? All alchemy I have seen requires a person with intent to guide its power, that\u0027s the whole point. And yet, this mineral, this dumb unconscious rock, has the ability to do the same as a person.\nAm I causing damage to other places if I bring charged runium there? Is it going to start making other rocks into unwanted air.\nMany of these things seem to be experimentally verifiable, thankfully. I may learn something new about the way alchemy works.",
