      "desc:8": "Yes, the \u0027prison\u0027 that the Eldritch creatures placed on me affects the way I interface with reality.\nI felt it within myself, a trace, a path that, I believe, will lead me home. I can prime a wormhole towards coordinates I think will lead me to Earth.\nAnd yet, I am stopped in this pursuit. A wall has been placed around me, blocking me from doing the wrong thing, this much is evident.\nI can but scratch this wall, and while all I can get out of it is fragments of this prison, I know that, with enough time, I may be able to reverse engineer it.\nThis is the first time I encountered such a hard limitation in what I can do... except dying of course. Because of this, I can assume that the intentions of the one who imprisoned me, at least for the time being, align with my current goals.\nI should be wary of this, and test these barriers more and more, whenever I encounter them.",
