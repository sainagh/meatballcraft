Not fully.\nMy actions, even if by mere causality, are still bound to the Meatball Man. He is the one who started this. If it hadn\u0027t been for him, the prophecies of the Arbiter would not have come to be. I would not have been able to reach the Proxima Belt, and undergo my path to Ascension.\nNo, I am not yet free. There is still one place that is precluded from me. My home. A home I would hesitate to return to, even if I was able to. And yet, I want the choice to come back.\nThe war of Terra is over, but my fight is not.\nOn Zoi, cultists of the Meatball Man, left traces of the  nature of their cult. One where fate and prophecy play a dominant role.\nIf I am to ramp up the fight, I too shall gain more insight into this, into the Mission, into Fate itself. Into a Mission that was left undone by the disappearence of the Arbiter, and one that I shall aid in continuing.",
