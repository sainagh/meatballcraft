      "desc:8": "True awareness of Definition will take some effort, but for now, I will start trying to understand Infinity.\nYes, baby steps, I say jokingly. Only Infinity, simple enough. \nWell, infinity itself is not something I can yet grasp, but I have seen mythic matter exhibit its properties in the past, in the form of a sort of catalyst.\nThe magnificent matter of Alkemia can interface with it directly, it can touch the base layer of recursion, and resonate with it.\nAlchemy is the type of magic I am most confident with, I can now safely say it, so using it to understand something so powerful should hopefully push my skills with this magic even further.\nIf the goal is Definition, anything gained on the path to get there will be more than useful.",
