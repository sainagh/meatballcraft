      "desc:8": "I am not the only one showing interest in Candyland, it seems. The forces of the Meatball Man, coming from Oi, are on the move too.\nA powerful Meatball Fiend is taunting me, almost as if it wanted me to fight back. This falls in line with whatever the Meatball Man has been doing whenever he showed up. Threats, annoyance, and a seemingly premature defeat despite clear hints of having incredible power that could easily overwhelm me. I guess this type of trickery is what\u0027s to be expected from the lord of desire and its minions.\nI know I shouldn\u0027t feel this way, but part of me is thankful to the Meatball Man for doing this. He is showing me how powerful my foes can really be, and I can prepare for it.\nBut what is his aim with regards to my fate? Why do I feel like these encounters are being purposefully set up? What does the Meatball Man want from me?",
