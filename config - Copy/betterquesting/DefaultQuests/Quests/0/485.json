The number of worlds I have visited so far is big enough to provide some statistical insight on this, and yet, the more I see, the less alchemy I encounter.\nSo likely, there must be some bias. Sure, producing countless resources with EMC is useful, but the types of resources I can make is not necessarily desirable. Tons of iron is worth near nothing in an economy where Sednanite and Dimensional Shards exist. And if food is so easily obtained through biological systems like Gardencia\u0027s, there really is not much use to the basic abilities provided by alchemy.\nIs it possible that planets populated by alchemists were just snobbed by my enemies as not powerful enough? It sounds outrageous to me now, as I think alchemy is incredibly powerful, but looking from the outside it may just look like a tool of convenience, unfit for a military empire...",
