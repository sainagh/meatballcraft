      "desc:8": "After defeating some mythic beings, I think it\u0027s time for more wormholes!\nThe Testificates on Diamerisma let me know that the world of Vibe has something I may be looking for.\nEvery time a wormhole is opened, it is bound to a set of special locations scattered around the universe.\nEach of this locations contains a special mineral, like Dimensional Shards on Terra, that directs the warping of space-time in such a way to \u0027bind\u0027 the wormhole singularity. This is how the Shyre Empire found its buffer worlds to begin with. They opened wormholes unbound to any location, and they saw where they went. This is also how the Testificates, without knowledge of the other worlds in the empire, were able to attempt retaliation, although in a somewhat uneffective manner.\nMost of these minerals are worthless, and present in small traces, which is why places like Taerrapiatta and Furatto did not have any special resources, but Vibe contains something very interesting, or so I was told!\nI was also warned about this place, only a handful of Testificate wizards, six of them, after even seeing this place, dared to enter it.
