      "desc:8": "Another child of Earth\u0027s rush towards energetic independence, plasma accelerators were an interesting concept. The concept had moderate success, but it never took off. \nWhere it truly found a use, though, was for the synthesis of high-density nuclei in research labs. Here, I think, this technology can find a similar use as a faster, albeit energy-negative, alternative to magnetic confinement fusion for making gases and low-density isotopes.",
