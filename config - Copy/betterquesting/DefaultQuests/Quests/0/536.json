      "desc:8": "Most of the surface of Finem is made out of a strange sedimentary stone that has been created by the existence of this planet\u0027s inhabitants.\nLasers and explosions can have a long lasting impact on a planet, and this is the proof for it. Very little is left here outside of the monuments of a long-lost civilization.\nThere are some remarkable things that can be inferred out of this place, though. Ender dolomite has recursive properties I know to be originated from the chickens and their affinity with chaos and entropy. This means that recursion, this power that so weirdly eludes me, is tied to entropy, and the universal law of the path of least energy.",
